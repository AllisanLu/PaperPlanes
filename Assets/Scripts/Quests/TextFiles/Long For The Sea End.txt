[NAME=Young Man]I can’t stand living with those people for another second. He keeps drinking away what little money we have and expects me to obey him?

This is not what living is. I want to explore and live my own life in the open seas, away from stagnation and towards adventure.

"Well I guess one last call wouldn’t hurt anyone."

A call for new sailors. I guess there’s no better way to start than to put my foot through the door. Well I’m off.
