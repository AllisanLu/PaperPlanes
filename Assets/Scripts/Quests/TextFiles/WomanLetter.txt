[NAME=Woman]What's this?

Is this a message from the goddess? 

You must've felt lonely too in this time Mistra. 

Thank you for bringing this message from across the isles. 

It brings me comfort that the people of the other island share that same loneliness in their hearts. 

It means that they miss us too. That gives me the strength to continue on.
