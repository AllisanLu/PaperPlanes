[NAME=Old Man]What am I doing? Such a washed scrap barely clinging on to life. I used to captain the finest vessel on these high seas.

And for my own first mate to backstab me… Though I still long for a return to the seas, for I enjoy her waves and sense of adventure.

However, what can I do? What is a crewless captain’s purpose but to to waste away along a stagnant shoreline with his lone dinghy forever.

[NAME=]The old man then decides to write on the plane a last call for crew members to join him.

[NAME=Old Man]Well I guess one last call wouldn’t hurt anyone.
