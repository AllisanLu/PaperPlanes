Seasons changing, summer starts to leave

Autumn falls on me, fall, winter, and spring

Eighty degrees, warmin' up for me

I fell deep, sun ain't have to leave

Open my eyes and see

We will float over water, leaning into shore

As we make our nirvana, sacred, so pure

Lift up the child, I know we will
