[NAME=Adastrum]Oh, a letter

[NAME=Adastrum]...

[NAME=Adastrum]Throughout time the brave sail the oceans wide
For treasures and glory that fills one's pride

[NAME=Adastrum]Though the seas care not what floats above
She speaks in only chaos thereof

[NAME=Adastrum]Without a path to see where to
The ship shall fall along with its crew

[NAME=Adastrum]Though one shant fear for hope draws near
The goddess of wind and her gift appears

[NAME=Adastrum]She shall steer the ships from left to right
To a place of safety that glows quite bright

[NAME=Adastrum]For the man that mans the luster one scopes
You and the wind are heroes, beacons of hope.
