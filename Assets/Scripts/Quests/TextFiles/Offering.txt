[NAME=Woman] Our people have been sundered. 

I see so many sailors gazing out at their beloved sea with loneliness and despair in their eyes. 

We can no longer sea or speak to our loved ones across that sea. 

Despite being able to see the other island with our naked eye on a clear day, we know the journey is too dangerous. 

Our people are strong, but such loneliness has encompassed our island. 

I imagine my brethren across the sea feel the same. 

Only your return can mend the loneliness that's taken hold of our hearts, goddess!
