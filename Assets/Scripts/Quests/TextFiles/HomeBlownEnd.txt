[NAME=Wife of Hemp]A letter?

[NAME=Wife of Hemp]To my everlasting love and my beautiful little children...

If you can read this, I remain trapped in a small cove and the island with sheer cliffs, where the wind blows strong as the night grows long. 

I pray for the chance to see your faces for another day.

I have hopes, so I'll wait until my last breath.

[NAME = Wife of Hemp] Oh dear! He's cold and alone all by himself out there... Lucy! James! Get dressed and follow me! Your father is in trouble, and we need to help him!

[NAME = Wife of Hemp] Please be fine. Please be fine...
