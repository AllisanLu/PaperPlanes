** Multiple choice ** (Needs work)

But you'd probably still want everything in the same file right?

[CHOICE=Y] YES
[CHOICE=N] NO

{Y} Well you're in luck, that's what we're doing here!

{N} Ah, well you can really do a number of things, but I'll tell you my way.

You need 2 things really.

1) You need a way to mark choices.
2) You need a way to mark the next line of dialogue to say.

With these you could probably make a system to handle elementary branching dialouge.

Too much branching dialogue could be a headache for this system, if you think this is necessary for your game, you'll definitely want to develop a more modular system..
